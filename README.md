## Plugin system
The engine offers to users plugin system very similiar to the plugin system of Ogre engine. Frankly said, BlackEngine was inspired by Ogre 
and contain many similiar concepts. With plugins you can extend BlackEngine functionality. Plugins are just shared libraries contain 
*BlackPluginInstall* and *BlackPluginUninstall* exported functions.
